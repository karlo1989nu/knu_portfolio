                    <p>
                        Hello, I'm Karlo Navarro, I am student of Computer Science at University of the People but also student of the 
                        Full-Stack Engineer career path at Codecademy and I can tell you that I am learning a lot while I am having so much fun. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I started to study Computer Science back in 2016 as a part-time student but soon I started to take more and more classes in
                        order to complete faster my Associate degree and I can proudly say that, by the end of 2021, I will be graduating from the Associate degree.
                        I am planning to continue my career with the Bachelors and I dream to take a Master in Artificial Intelligence and Quantum Computing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        At Codecademy I started in 2020 in the middle of the Covid-19 pandemic, I started taking a HTML and soon realized the great methodology they have
                        and decided to enroll in the full course after asking my step parents to pay me the full year subscription. They did help me and it made me feel very 
                        motivated to continue to learn programming so I continued with the CSS and Javascript courses to, later, enroll in the Full-Stack career path.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I am very proud of all the learning I am gaining and I know there's still a lot to learn, I have great people around like my friend Fabio who is always willing
                        to help with the topics that aren't easy to understand.
                    </p>
